# Code

This folder contains all of the code required for the analysis completed in the paper. They contain:
* **master.py** - the master script.
* **analysis.py** - the python script which contains the module I have created for the analysis.

The code uses some modules that I have created, which can be found in the **modules** repository on my page. 

Note that where the **file_path** module is used, this is just a python file containing the folder path. I have done this to keep my user and area disclosed. 

Please let me know if you have any comments!
